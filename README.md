Machete is a web application that manages a day labor referral service.
Machete tracks work orders for employers looking for short term, casual
labor. It also provides a means for matching laborers with specific
skills to requests made by employers for skilled labor.

Machete performs the following tasks:

1. Stores basic contact information for all persons associated with the
   Machete system
2. Stores biographical and membership information on its members
3. Records member sign-in using a identification number through either a
   bar code scanner or the keyboard
4. Captures employer, work order, and work assignment details into a
   relational database
5. Provides a fast, flexible method of dispatching workers to work
   orders based on English level, skill level, and employer requests
